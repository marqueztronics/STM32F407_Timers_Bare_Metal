# STM32F407 Timers Bare Metal Implementation.

A simple implementation of a General Purpose Timer driver on STM32F407.

This driver is written without using any kind of HAL or LL libraries. Completely bare-metal code. This project was developed after finishing Udemy's course [Mastering Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-microcontroller-with-peripheral-driver-development). The purpose of the project is to practice the concepts learned during the course.

Some test applications are developed to test the drivers using the built-in LEDs on the [STM32F407G-DISC1 discovery kit](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html).

This project also has the purpose of learning basic concepts related to version control, Git and GitHub.
